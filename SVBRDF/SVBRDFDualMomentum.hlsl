//a more generalized approach can be sighted. It means a generalized appraoch of main functions here
//could prevent dissmiss inner properties of SVBDRF models resulting equations. Then, let s add functions to the main models.
//In fact, it means removing artifacts in the old knowledge of textures. At first, we mixed 2 textures. But here, 
//we will then add functions for two textures. Resulting in a different rendering equation. Notice that it could be done with SVBRDF functions.
//We can use my scipy repository in forked with WKB support.
